Mess Feedback System
This is a comprehensive system which is designed to provide an interface for authorities and students to effectively communicate the drawbacks of the food served in mess.
 Problem & Objectives
The Problem: Unstructured feedback and checking leads to improper assessment of messs food leading to dissatisfaction of students and also the overall process is very inefficient.
The Solution Objectives:
Data Integrity: The feedback is standardised by a system of rating(0-10)
System Efficiency: Provide a quick, menu-driven interface for students to submit feedback and authorities to check drawbacks.
Reporting: Complies the feedback to an AVERAGE RATING and COMPLAINITS
 Features at a Glance
Feature
Description
Key Output
Give Opinion
Collects date, day, meal choice, rating (0-10), and detailed comments.
Appends data to studentopinion.csv.
View Average Rating
Calculates overall student satisfaction.
Prints the single average score (e.g., 7.45 / 10).
View Complaints
Isolates critical issues for immediate management attention.
Lists all comments where the rating is 2 or lower.
Menu System
Simple, numbered command-line interface.
Ensures ease of use and high participation.


 Data Structure Note
Meal descriptions are managed using a highly readable, two-level Python dictionary (MEAL_MENU) that maps the day of the week to the specific breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner item. This structure allows the menu to be updated without changing the core program logic.
All feedback is stored in studentopinion.csv.
Phase 1: Foundation (file_init() and Data)
Goal: Initialize the CSV file and define the menu structure.
Logic:
Attempt to create studentopinion.csv with headers.
Handle FileExistsError silently (Pass).
Menu data (MEAL_MENU) is stored as a nested dictionary for easy lookups.
Phase 2: Validation (get_valid_input and Validators)
Goal: Ensure 100% data quality before writing to the file.
Logic:
Loop until valid input is received for any prompt.
Use specific validators:
Date: Check format YYYY-MM-DD.
Rating: Check if R is integer.
Day/Choice: Lookup against MEAL_MENU to ensure the meal exists.
Catch ValueError to re-prompt the user clearly.
Phase 3: Feedback Submission (give_opinion())
Goal: Collect and persist validated data.
Logic:
Collect all inputs (Date, Day, Choice, Rating, Comment) using validation functions.
TRY to open the CSV in append mode ("a").
Write the complete, validated feedback row.
CATCH any file writing errors.
Phase 4: Reporting and Analysis
4.1 view_average_rating()
Goal: Calculate the overall student satisfaction score.
Logic:
Initialize Total Rating (T=0) and Count (C=0).
TRY to read the CSV file, skipping the header.
FOR each row: Attempt to convert the rating column to an integer; T \T + R, C \ C + 1.
Handle malformed rows by skipping them.
If C>0, calculate and display Average = T/C.
CATCH FileNotFoundError.
4.2 view_complaints()
Goal: Isolate critical issues for management (Rating ).
Logic:
TRY to read the CSV file, skipping the header.
FOR each row:
Convert rating $R$ to integer.
IF R \ 2: Print the full complaint details (Date, Meal, Comment).
If no complaints found, print a positive message.
CATCH FileNotFoundError.
Phase 5: Control Flow (main_menu())
Goal: Tie all components together in a continuous user loop.
Logic:
Call file_init() on startup.
WHILE TRUE: Display menu options (1-4).
Direct user input to the correct function call (give_opinion, view_complaints, etc.).
BREAK loop only on "Exit" (choice 4).
